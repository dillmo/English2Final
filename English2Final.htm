                <p>
                    <em>The Third of May 1808</em> is a Romantic painting by Francisco Goya which depicts the execution of Spaniards
                    by a Napoleonic firing squad. This mass execution occured when the Spanish revolted in response to Napoleon
                    installing his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as king of Spain. The revolt would grow into the Peninsular
                    War, also called the Spanish Ulcer.</p>

                <h2 id="romantic">Romanticism</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>The Third of May 1808</em> helped shape the Romantic period with its breaks from both Enlightenment and
                    Renaissance thought and Renaissance painting. The subject matter of
                    <em>The Third of May 1808</em> is decidedly anti-Enlightement. It focuses on and romanticizes the atrocities
                    the French committed during the Peninsular War. At the time, France was the French Empire, ruled by Napoleon
                    Bonaparte and the direct result of the French Revolution. The French Revolution was a radically liberal
                    political revolution which tore through class, destroyed the clergy, and committed many atrocities, including
                    genocide, in an effort to find stability. The world saw the French Empire as the terrifying end result
                    of the French Revolution, as it turned on itself. They saw the French Revolution as the prime example
                    of the dangers of Enlightenment political thought, which enshrined Liberalism and the Republic.
                    <em>The Third of May 1808</em> showed the worst of how the French Revolution affected Spain. It furthered
                    supported this perspective by placing a man in a white shirt and arms raised as if he were on a cross
                    at the painting's focal point. This man represented Jesus, which many believed the Enlightenment, and
                    definitely Revolutionary France, put under assault.</p>

                <p>
                    <em>The Third of May 1808</em> also cried out against war, which was heavily romanticized before the Enlightenment.
                    Instead, it romanticized human life and emotion, with visible fear in the Spaniards' faces. Goya painted
                    the men in his painting unflatteringly, rather than with the idealized forms of the Renaissance. He portrayed
                    them more as humans, relatable to those who view his painting, than as gods.</p>

                <h2 id="war">Peninsular War</h2>
                <p>The Peninsular War is the larger conflict
                    <em>The Third of May 1808</em> portrays a portion of. In 1807, France occupied the Iberian Peninsula under
                    Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1808, Napoleon installed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as King José I of Spain.
                    Almost immediately, the Spanish rebelled in Madrid,the capital of Spain. The French tried to stamp out
                    the rebellion with mass executions, one of which is depicted in
                    <em>The Third of May 1808</em>, but insurrections soon popped up in other cities around the peninsula. This
                    larger conflict is today known as the Peninsular War, but was called the War for Independence in Spain
                    and has also been called the Spanish Ulcer. The French largely stamped out the rebellion in 1810, but
                    Spain continued to simmer and required a large portion of the French army to keep under control.</p>

                <p>In 1808, the British Duke of Wellington landed soldiers in Portugal. There, they fought inconclusively until
                    1812, when Napoleon had to remove a portion of his soldiers from the Iberian theater to bolster his campaign
                    in Russia. This gave Wellington the space he needed to slowly advance his forces into Spain, and eventually
                    force the French out in 1814, at which point Wellington had begun advancing into France.</p>

                <h2 id="goya">Francisco Goya</h2>
                <p>Francisco Goya was a Spanish painter, born in Aragon, who lived from 1746 to 1828. A prodigy, he became a
                    painter's apprentice at the age of 14. At 19, he worked for a painter in Madrid named Francisco Bayeu,
                    then married Bayeu's sister in 1773. He briefly visited Rome, then returned to Madrid to create a series
                    for 40 tapestry designs in 1775. In 1783, he became King Charles III of Spain's chief painter. He then
                    went deaf in 1792. Goya continued to paint for the royal court under French occupation, but was not punished
                    after France pulled out of Spain. However, the Spanish court was hostile to Goya after his work under
                    Joseph Bonaparte, so he moved to Bordeaux, in France. He lived in a villa in Bordeaux for the rest of
                    his life.</p>

                <p>Goya's paintings were frequently unflattering and occasionally erotic, so much so that he was questioned
                    by the Inquisition for his painting,
                    <em>Naked Maja</em>. After the Napoleonic Wars, Goya's paintings became more dark in theme, and he made more
                    use of drab palettes. Most of his later paintings were makred by his disillusionment with war, and many,
                    such as
                    <em>The Witches' Sabbath</em> were dreadful in nature.</p>
