                    <em>The Third of May 1808</em> is a Romantic painting by Francisco Goya which depicts the execution of Spaniards
                    by a Napoleonic firing squad. This mass execution occured when the Spanish revolted in response to Napoleon installing his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as king of Spain. The revolt would grow into the Peninsular War, also called the Spanish Ulcer.</p>

                <p>The Peninsular War is the larger conflict <em>The Third of May 1808</em> portrays a portion of. In 1807, France occupied the Iberian Peninsula under Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1808, Napoleon installed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as King Jos√© I of Spain. Almost immediately, the Spanish rebelled in Madrid,the capital of Spain. The French tried to stamp out the rebellion with mass executions, one of which is depicted in <em>The Third of May 1808</em>, but insurrections soon popped up in other cities around the peninsula. This larger conflict is today known as the Peninsular War, but was called the War for Independence in Spain and has also been called the Spanish Ulcer. The French largely stamped out the rebellion in 1810, but Spain continued to simmer and required a large portion of the French army to keep under control.
                
                In 1808, the British Duke of Wellington landed soldiers in Portugal. There, they fought inconclusively until 1812, when Napoleon had to remove a portion of his soldiers from the Iberian theater to bolster his campaign in Russia. This gave Wellington the space he needed to slowly advance his forces into Spain, and eventually force the French out in 1814, at which point Wellington had begun advancing into France.</p>
